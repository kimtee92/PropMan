# Security Best Practices & Hardening

This document outlines the security measures implemented in PropMan and best practices for deployment.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with NextAuth.js
- ✅ 15-minute session timeout for enhanced security
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Viewer)
- ✅ Protected API routes with authentication middleware
- ✅ Secure password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- ✅ API rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP
- ✅ In-memory rate limiting (use Redis for production scale)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old rate limit records

### 3. Security Headers
- ✅ `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- ✅ `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- ✅ `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- ✅ `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- ✅ `Permissions-Policy` - Disables unnecessary browser features
- ✅ `Content-Security-Policy` - Restricts resource loading (production)

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ MongoDB query sanitization (prevents NoSQL injection)
- ✅ ObjectId format validation
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Password strength validation (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- ✅ File name sanitization (prevents path traversal)
- ✅ File type validation

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ Sanitized error messages in production (no stack traces)
- ✅ Generic error responses (don't expose internal details)
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes

### 6. File Upload Security
- ✅ File type validation (server-side via UploadThing)
- ✅ File size limits enforced
- ✅ Secure file storage via UploadThing
- ✅ Automatic file deletion when records are deleted

### 7. Database Security
- ✅ Mongoose schema validation
- ✅ Password hashing (never store plaintext)
- ✅ Indexed queries for performance
- ✅ Connection string in environment variables

### 8. Audit Logging
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail for sensitive operations
- ✅ User tracking for all changes
- ✅ Timestamp and IP logging capability

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Strong random string (32+ characters)
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Correct production URL
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` - Production database with authentication
- [ ] `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` - From UploadThing dashboard
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to version control

### Database Security
- [ ] Enable MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Use strong database passwords
- [ ] Whitelist only necessary IP addresses
- [ ] Enable MongoDB encryption at rest
- [ ] Regular database backups
- [ ] Use connection string with `retryWrites=true&w=majority`

### Network Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS only (Vercel provides this automatically)
- [ ] Configure custom domain with SSL
- [ ] Enable DDoS protection (Vercel provides this)

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts

### Access Control
- [ ] Remove demo accounts in production
- [ ] Implement proper user onboarding
- [ ] Regular access review for admin users
- [ ] Enforce strong password policy

### Application Security
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Run `npm audit` regularly
- [ ] Use `npm audit fix` to patch vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and minimize package dependencies

## Additional Recommendations

### For Production Scale

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement Redis-based rate limiting for multi-instance deployments
   - Consider using a service like Upstash for serverless Redis

2. **Session Management**
   - Consider implementing session invalidation on password change
   - Add "active sessions" management for users
   - Implement device tracking

3. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Consider adding 2FA for admin accounts
   - Use authenticator apps or SMS-based 2FA

4. **Security Monitoring**
   - Set up Sentry or similar for error tracking
   - Monitor for unusual activity patterns
   - Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts

5. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Implement automated database backups
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Document disaster recovery plan

6. **Compliance**
   - Review GDPR/privacy law requirements
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Add privacy policy and terms of service
   - Implement user data export/deletion

## Security Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/portfolios; done

# Test SQL injection attempts (should be sanitized)
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/credentials \
  -d "email[$gt]=&password[$gt]="

# Check security headers
curl -I https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Automated Testing
- Run `npm audit` before each deployment
- Consider adding security-focused tests
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate all secrets (NEXTAUTH_SECRET, database passwords)
   - Review audit logs for suspicious activity
   - Invalidate all active sessions if necessary

2. **Investigation**
   - Check Vercel logs for unusual patterns
   - Review database access logs
   - Check for unauthorized data access

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch the vulnerability
   - Notify affected users if data was compromised
   - Document the incident and response

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be patched before disclosure

## Security Updates

This security document should be reviewed and updated:
- After each major feature addition
- Quarterly as a minimum
- After any security incident
- When new threats emerge
